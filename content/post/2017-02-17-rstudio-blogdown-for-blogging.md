I recently discovered Rstudio [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and this is a post written in plain Markdown (`*.md`) and created via blogdown. 

I have installed the blogdown package along with Hugo, and I followed the 
walkthroughs in the following websites to set up the blog, choose a theme and
deploy the blog on Github Pages.
